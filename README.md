With a keen interest in technology, I've delved into the world of computer engineering for the past four years, building a strong foundation in various programming languages, system architecture, and effective problem-solving strategies.

Notably, I've also participated in Tech Elevator, further expanding my skills and knowledge in the tech field. Concurrently, I'm in the final semester of my college education, adding to my academic journey and preparing for a promising future.

With a profound interest in technology, I immersed myself in the world of computer engineering for the past four years. 
This journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in various programming languages, system architecture, and problem-solving methodologies. 
Currently, I'm embarking on an exciting adventure in the Java Coding Bootcamp through Tech Elevator, aiming to further enhance my skills and stay at the cutting edge of the ever-evolving tech industry.
